What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

If you initialize a repository in a directory, in this directory you'll get .git and this means you can start track the changes in this directory using git commands.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the median area between working directory and repository. When file is added here it's in the repository, but you can't control changes in the file yet.
